JPR External Paper Writing Points :- 
s
1)Title:- Develop program to implement: Single inheritance.
2)Title Related Information :- Single inheritance in Java is a type of inheritance where a subclass (child class) 
				inherits from only one superclass (parent class). This means the subclass gets the properties and 
				behaviors (fields and methods) 
				of that one superclass.
3)Program :-
	// Parent class
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Child class
class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.eat();  // Inherited method
        myDog.bark(); // Own method
    }
}

4)Output :-
	This animal eats food.
	The dog barks.

5)Conclusion :-
		The program shows single inheritance in Java, where the Dog class inherits from the Animal class. 
		It reuses the eat() method from the parent and adds its own bark() method, showing how inheritance 
		supports code reuse and extension.
